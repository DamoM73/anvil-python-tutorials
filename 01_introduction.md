# Introduction

In this course, we will explore the exciting world of web development, learning how to create interactive and dynamic websites using Anvil, a platform that allows us to build web applications entirely with Python. By the end of the course, we will have the skills to design, develop, and deploy our very own web applications, which  can be share with friends, family, and the broader community.

## Importance of web development

Web development is crucial in today's digital age as it serves as the backbone for creating and maintaining websites and web applications that are essential for businesses, education, and personal use. It enables us to establish an online presence, reach a global audience, and provide interactive and dynamic user experiences. By mastering web development, we will gain the ability to build platforms for e-commerce, social networking, information sharing, and much more.

## The Project

To assist in this journey, we will create an application to assist students in planning their study. The app allows users to upload their assessment details and then it will then track assessments and provide a calendar which shows when the most assessment pressure is. Check the link below to see the finished app.

## Required Knowledge

Scince Anvil apps are written in Python, you will only need to know one programming language. You don't even need to know HTML or CSS (they can be useful for more advanced features).

Before starting this course you will need foundational Python skills along with some more intermediate knowledge. The table below details the skillset, along with my other courses that will provide such knowledge.
